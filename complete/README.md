# rest-api-example
This GitHub repository serves as an entry point for API development. It is themed around a prototype for an employee datebase API. 

## Documentation
The API documentation is found in the documentation folder. It is written in the OpenAPI 3.0 specification style. To read and edit it, I highly recommend using the following online editor: https://editor.swagger.io/

## Development
This Java project is using the SpringBoot framework. It is one of the most popular Java frameworks for (micro-)service development. To learn more, check out the official documentation: https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot

To properly import this project, it is required to use Maven or Gradle. Both are tools to help build and deploy code projects, as they take care of dependencies. Maven: https://maven.apache.org/ Gradle: https://gradle.org/

The code itself includes comments to help understand it. It is not optimized in any way, it's main purpose is to showcase the development of APIs.

## Postman
This project includes a Postman collection, which can be found in the postman folder. Postman is a tool for API development and testing. Importing the collection into Postman will provide the user with all necessary API requests to test and play around with the API.
